# tic-tac-toe

**_Goal_**
Create the legendary Tic Tac Toe Game, for the web browser.
Caveat being, using both JS Factory Functions and Modules.

Another TheOdinProject, project (word salad, I know :D ), complete.

**_Skills_Learned_**

1. IFFE (Immediately Invoked Func Exp.)
2. Closures (in detail)
3. JS Traditional Module/Revealing-Module Patterns
4. JS Factory Pattern

**_Thoughts_**

This project was challenging. Mainly, due to the concepts of IFFEs and closures,
taking a bit longer for myself, to grasp.
Slowly but surely, it all began making sense, after scouring for more resources,
on the aforementioned subject matters, apart from what TheOdinProject provided.
Putting the project together and getting my hands in on the code,
definitely reinforced the concepts, as expected.

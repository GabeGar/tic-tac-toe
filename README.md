# tic-tac-toe

**_Goal_**
Create the legendary Tic Tac Toe Game, for the web browser.
Caveat being, using both JS Factory Functions and Modules.

Another TheOdinProject, project (word salad, I know :D ), complete.

**_Skills_Learned_**

1. IFFE (Immediately Invoked Func Exp.)
2. JS Traditional Module/Revealing-Module Patterns
3. JS Factory Pattern

**_Thoughts_**

This project was very challenging. Syntax threw me off 100%
Had to dig around the internet a bit more, than solely rely on the resources provided to me,
via TheOdinProject.com; As well as, read up/watch a few more tutorials;
Slowly but surely, it all began making sense. Especially, when getting my own hands dirty,
with the code itself.

While it was not easy to digest at first, doing the aforementioned,
further deepened, my understanding of these learned patterns in JS.
